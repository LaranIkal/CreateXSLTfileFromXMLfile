Title: 

How to use the converter from XML to CSV file formats.


Description: 

The process extracts the data from the xml file and gets the csv output file 
by using the xslt file and the xslt processor written in Java.
To create the Java xslt processor I took ideas from: https://gist.github.com/serge1/9307868

Getting started:

	- Install Java version 17+ on the computer you will use to run the process.
	

Assumptions:

- The file will be ready to be imported to Excel, the fields will be between qoutes. The numeric and date fields 
	don't have a problem if they are double quoted when imported.
- Only Include Employee Status Active and OnLeave, The integration design only mentions these two
- I am using XSLT 1.0 in preparation for the conversion processed to be run using Java.
- I changed employee ID 00000281780 status to OnLeave to show that the process works with Employees with Status OnLeave.
- For now the only shell program included is to run on Linux environments, but you can create a shell/batch file to run it 
	in any other environment, it will run like this:
	java -jar ./XsltTransform.jar ElegibilityEmployeesDataToCSV.xslt EmployeesData.xml ${OUTPUTFILENAME}
	OUTPUTFILENAME must be filename.csv
- You must have ksh installed.

Installing:

	- Copy all files to a folder, like /tmp
	- Open a terminal in the folder you stored the files.
	- Ensure you can execute the shell file, run: chmod +x ElegibilityEmployeesDataToCSV.ksh 
	
Executing the program:

	- Open a terminal in the folder you have all the files.
	- execute the next command: ./ElegibilityEmployeesDataToCSV.ksh
	This will generate the csv file. You only need to list your files and you will see the csv generated.
