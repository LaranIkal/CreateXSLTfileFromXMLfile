How I generated the XSLT file with the help of ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot.

These are the questions I asked to ChatGPT to get the XSLT file, *The response is the XSLT file:
===>>> Create the appropriate XSLT to transform the next .xml file to create a .csv file
===>>> make the XSLT more humanly generated
===>>> I want the output to Excel
===>>> There are multiple Organization_Data fields

The conditions:
===>>> Include this conditions: For Employee_Status only print A for Active and L for On Leave, and add leading zeros to $costCenter when it is less than 8 chars

Additional fields and requirements:
===>>> Add full $legal as first field to the left of the file
===>>> each field value must be double quoted, there are some that have commas
===>>> I am processing the XSLT in Java, I am getting: line 121: Required attribute 'select' is missing.
	The cause wass: Java's default XSLT 1.0 processors (like Xalan) do not support 1 to $padCount, which is XSLT 2.0 syntax.
	
===>>> rewrite the complete XSLT
===>>> include this Selection Criteria: include only rows where Employee_Status are Active, Company begins with 'ESI' or (Company = 'EUK' And Cost Center = ELGBR10121775)
===>>> Include this conditions: For Employee_Status only print A for Active and L for On Leave, and add leading zeros to $costCenter when it is less than 8 chars

I was only getting the Active employees, so I went to Github Copilot and asked it:

===>>> I have this xslt file:(pasted all my xslt file)
I need to include the Employee_Status OnLeave 

Copilot told me I just needed to fix the line below in my xslt file and add the OnLeave part:
<xsl:for-each select="//ws:Worker[ws:Status/ws:Employee_Status = 'Active' or ws:Status/ws:Employee_Status = 'OnLeave']">

The file was not exactly as needed but I just changed my variables.
